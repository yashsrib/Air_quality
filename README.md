  Explored the data to understand its structure and contents.

- **Data Visualization**
  - **Univariate Analysis**  
    Visualized individual variables to examine distributions and detect outliers.
  - **Bivariate Analysis**  
    Analyzed relationships between two variables.
  - **Multivariate Analysis**  
    Explored interactions between three or more variables.

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Encoded the categorical variables for machine learning readiness.
